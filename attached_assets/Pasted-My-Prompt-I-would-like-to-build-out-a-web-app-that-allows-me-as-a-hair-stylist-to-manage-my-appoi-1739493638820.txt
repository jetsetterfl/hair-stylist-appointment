My Prompt: 

I would like to build out a web app that allows me as a hair stylist to manage my appointments and my customer the ability to make appointments. The app should have a owner interface - where I can tell what times I am available and on what days along with breaks etc that I may want to take. Make it easy and simple as a owner for me to allocate my availability. Each appointment will be default to 45 mins. between each appointment, I would like to take a 15 min break so the next appointment should only start after my break. The customer interface will most likely be launched from my facebook or social media site via a link to make an appointment. It should look at my availability and let a person make an appointment. I would like to use an agent to build out an app like this - can you enhance this prompt for me first. Second, once the enhanced prompt is ready - you can help me build out this web app.

GEMINI's Enhanced Prompt:

Okay, let's enhance your prompt to be more suitable for an agent (like a large language model or a specialized development tool) to help you build your hair stylist appointment web app. We'll break down the requirements more clearly and add some important considerations.

Enhanced Prompt for Hair Stylist Appointment Web App Development

I want to build a web application for managing hair stylist appointments, with two distinct interfaces: one for the stylist (owner) and one for customers.

1. Stylist (Owner) Interface:

Availability Management:

Daily/Weekly View: A calendar-like interface to easily set available days and times. Should allow for recurring weekly schedules (e.g., available every Tuesday and Thursday).
Customizable Time Slots: The ability to define specific start and end times for work hours on each day.
Breaks: Easy input of break times (start and end). The system should automatically calculate appointment availability around these breaks. Breaks should be considered as unavailable time slots.
Default Appointment Duration: Appointments are typically 45 minutes long, with a 15-minute break after each appointment. The system should automatically calculate the next available appointment slot based on these durations and breaks.
Special Days/Exceptions: Ability to mark specific days as unavailable (e.g., holidays, personal time) or adjust work hours for a particular day.
Appointment Viewing/Management: A view to see all scheduled appointments, with the ability to edit or cancel them (with appropriate notifications to the customer).
Reporting: Basic reporting on appointment schedules (e.g., daily/weekly view of booked appointments).
User Authentication: Secure login for the stylist.

2. Customer Interface:

Appointment Booking:

Availability Display: A clear display of available appointment slots based on the stylist's defined schedule, taking into account appointment duration and breaks. Should prevent double-booking.
Date Selection: Easy navigation to select desired appointment date.
Time Selection: Display available start times for appointments.
Customer Information Input: Fields for name, contact information (phone number or email), and optionally, a brief description of the desired service.
Appointment Confirmation: Confirmation page displaying appointment details. Ideally, include an option for the customer to receive a confirmation email or SMS.
Appointment Cancellation (Optional): Allow customers to cancel their appointments (within a certain timeframe), with appropriate notifications to the stylist.
Integration (Desired): A simple way to integrate this booking page into my Facebook or other social media profiles (e.g., a link).

3. Technical Considerations:

Platform: (Specify if you have any preferences, e.g., web-based, mobile app, etc. A web-based app is likely the most versatile).
Database: (No need to specify a particular database at this stage unless you have a strong preference. The agent can suggest suitable options).
User Interface (UI) Design: Clean, intuitive, and user-friendly design for both interfaces.
Notifications: Email/SMS notifications for appointment confirmations, reminders (optional), and cancellations (if implemented). (This might be a later enhancement).
Scalability: The app should be designed to handle a reasonable number of appointments and users.
4. Development Process:

I'd like to work with the agent in an iterative manner, starting with a basic functional version and then adding features and refinements.
